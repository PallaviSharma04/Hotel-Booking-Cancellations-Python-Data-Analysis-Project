## Project Overview  
The City Hotel and Resort Hotel faces a significant challenge with booking cancellations in the year 2015-2017, affecting revenue, occupancy rates, and operational efficiency. This project analyzes booking data of the two hotels and explores patterns and trends in hotel booking cancellations through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By analyzing key factors such as average daily rate(ADR), lead time, customer type, deposit policies, market segment and identifying patterns in cancellation trends we aim to uncover insights that can help hotels minimize cancellations ,optimize booking strategies and improve their revenue management and customer satisfaction strategies.  

## Project Goals
✅ Identify key factors affecting hotel booking cancellations.

✅ Analyze seasonal trends and customer behavior.

✅ Analyze how variables like lead time, deposit type, customer type, and ADR (Average Daily Rate) impact cancellations.

✅ Compare cancellation trends across City Hotels and Resort Hotels.

✅ Provide actionable data-driven insights and recommendations to reduce cancellations.
